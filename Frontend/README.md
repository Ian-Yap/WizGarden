My Crypto Portfolio

The motivation for this project is to have a convenient "one-stop-shop" to view my cryptocurrencies portfolio without logging into a cryptocurrency exchange. To be able to come to a simple web app and see the performance of my portfolio is something I have wanted.

The target is to build upon this foundation and include my NFT(non-fungible token) portfolio into the app as well to have a comprehensive outlook of my portfolio.

It took me some time to source for the right API in order to display the data in a reliable fashion.

The project is built on React using mainly useState and useEffect hooks.
